While the AI correctly performs the term-by-term differentiation, it incorrectly assumes that the conditions given justify this operation. The condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ is a sufficient condition for the Weierstrass function to be nowhere differentiable, *not* a condition that allows term-by-term differentiation to yield a valid derivative. The Weierstrass function is a classic example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. Therefore, the derivative does *not* exist, despite the AI's formal manipulation.  The AI demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the concept by attempting to find a derivative where none exists.\n\n\n--- Problem #2: Consider f_n(x) = 2nx*e^(-nx¬≤) on [0, 1].

It correctly calculates both the limit of the integral and the integral of the limit, demonstrating that they are not equal.  The reasoning provided, including the change of variables for the integration and the explanation for the limit of f_n(x) going to zero, is clear and accurate. The conclusion correctly identifies the inequality and links it to the general principle of non-commutability of limits and integrals.\n\n\n--- Problem #3: Using the residue theorem from complex analysis, prove that ... ---\nJudger's Verdict: INCORRECT\nAssigned Score: 0.0\nJudger's Justification: Incorrect.\n\nThe student AI's solution attempts to use the function f(z) = 1/(z¬≤sin¬≤(œÄz)).  This function does *not* work for this proof. It leads to a series of incorrect and ultimately undefined residue calculations.  The AI recognizes some issues with its approach but fails to correct them and introduces further errors.  The suggested function g(z) = œÄ¬≤/(z¬≤sin¬≤(œÄz)) also has issues, and the explanation lacks crucial details, making it impossible to follow the logic to a valid conclusion.  The core problem is the choice of function; it should have been f(z) = œÄcot(œÄz)/z¬≤ as in the ground truth. The AI's reasoning about contour integration and the residue theorem is generally correct in principle but is misapplied due to the incorrect function choice. The final answer is stated correctly, but the derivation is entirely flawed.\n\n\n--- Problem #4: Prove the Brouwer fixed-point theorem: every continuous func... ---\nJudger's Verdict: INCORRECT\nAssigned Score: 0.0\nJudger's Justification: Incorrect.\n\nThe student AI attempts to use a homotopy argument, but makes crucial errors that invalidate the proof. Specifically, the construction of G(x,t) = H(x,t) / ||H(x,t)|| relies on the assumption that H(x,t) is never zero.  While true for x on the boundary (due to the no-fixed-point assumption), this is NOT guaranteed for interior points of D‚Åø. The AI incorrectly claims that  \"The denominator ||H(x,t)|| is well-defined because H(x,t)  cannot be the zero vector.\"  A counterexample is easily constructed:  Consider f(x) = -x on the unit ball. Then H(x, 1/2) = (1/2)x - (1/2)x = 0.  The subsequent arguments about retractions and homotopy invariance become meaningless due to this flawed construction. The core of the standard proof relies on homology, which is absent here.\n\n\n--- Problem #5: Apply the Baire Category Theorem to the space of continuous ... ---\nJudger's Verdict: INCORRECT\nAssigned Score: 0.0\nJudger's Justification: Incorrect.\n\nThe student AI's approach is fundamentally flawed. It attempts to define open sets U_n based on the derivative being bounded by n.  While the idea of using the Baire Category Theorem is correct, the chosen sets U_n do *not* work.  The AI claims these sets are open and their union is the set of differentiable functions, both of which are false.  For instance, consider a continuous function that is differentiable only at x=0, with f'(0) = 1.  It's in U_2, but arbitrarily small perturbations in the sup norm could create a function non-differentiable at 0 and with a derivative bounded by n everywhere else where it exists. Thus U_2 wouldn't necessarily contain that neighborhood.  The AI's argument about openness relies on the derivative being continuous *near* the point where |f'(x)| < n, which is not generally true for functions differentiable at a single point.  The AI also incorrectly applies the Baire Category Theorem, misunderstanding the conditions related to density and closures. The correct approach requires demonstrating that the sets E_n (as defined in the ground truth) are closed and nowhere dense, a property the AI does not attempt to establish for its chosen U_n.\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n                         OVERALL SUMMARY\n================================================================================\nTotal Problems Evaluated: 5\n------------------------------\nVerdict Distribution:\n  - Incorrect           : 4 (80.0%)\n  - Correct             : 1 (20.0%)\n------------------------------\nTotal Score Achieved: 1.00 / 5.00\nAVERAGE PERFORMANCE SCORE: 20.00%\n================================================================================\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport random\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Optional\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport google.generativeai as genai\n\ntry:\n    from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n    user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\n    api_key = user_secrets.get_secret(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\")\n    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)\n    # The print statement is optional, but helpful for debugging\n    # print(\"‚úÖ Successfully configured Gemini API from Kaggle Secrets.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # This will run if the secret is not found, e.g., you forgot to add it.\n    print(f\"‚ö†Ô∏è Could not configure Gemini API.

While f maps $D^n$ to itself, we must ensure that $f$ maps the boundary $\\partial D^n$ (the sphere of radius 1) to itself. This is vital.  The image of the boundary must also be within the ball, by construction of the homotopy.\n\n3. **H(x, 0) and H(x, 1):** $H(x, 0) = x$ and $H(x, 1) = f(x)$.\n\n\n4. **Degree:**  Since $H(x, t)$ is continuous and $H(x, 0)$ is simply the identity map on $D^n$, the Brouwer degree of $H(x, 0)$ is well-defined.  Furthermore, since $H$ is a continuous deformation, the degree of $H(x, t)$ is independent of $t$.\n\n\n5. **The contradiction (key step):** If $f$ has no fixed point, then $H(x, 1) = f(x)$ has no point $x$ where $H(x, 1) = x$. Hence, the degree of $f$ (or $H(x, 1)$) relative to $D^n$ is zero. However, the degree of $H(x, 0)$ (the identity map) is 1.  This is a contradiction, since the degree of a continuous mapping must remain constant under continuous deformations.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** This contradiction arises from the assumption that there is no fixed point. Hence, there must exist at least one $x$ in $D^n$ for which $f(x) = x$.\n\nTherefore, the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem holds.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's proof attempts to use Brouwer degree, but incorrectly assumes the boundary is mapped to itself, which is not a requirement of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and makes the degree argument invalid.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 2) | Action: verify_solution | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: **Final Answer:**\n\nConsider the continuous function $f: D^n \\to D^n$.

The degree of $\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}$ with respect to $0$ is $1$ (in $\\mathbb{R}^n$).\n\nBy contradiction, if $f$ has no fixed point, then deg($h, D^n, 0$) must be 0. However, deg($h, D^n, 0$) = deg($\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|}, D^n, 0$) = 1, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $f$ must have at least one fixed point.  Q.E.D.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: While the student attempts a proof using Brouwer degree, they incorrectly apply it to the function h, which is not defined at potential fixed points in the interior of D‚Åø, making the degree calculation invalid.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 3) | Action: final_answer_and_conclusion | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: **Final Answer (5/5):**\n\nTo prove Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, consider the continuous function $f: D^n \\to D^n$.  We define a homotopy $H: D^n \\times [0, 1] \\to D^n$ as $H(x, t) = x - t(x-f(x))$ for $x \\in D^n$ and $t \\in [0, 1]$.   Note that $H(x, 0) = x$ and $H(x, 1) = f(x)$.  Crucially, if $x$ is on the boundary of $D^n$, then $x-f(x)$ lies in $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus D^n$.\n\n\nNow, define the function $g(x) = x - f(x)$ for $x \\in D^n$.  We are interested in the set of points where $g(x) = 0$, which are the fixed points of $f$.  If $g(x) = 0$ for some $x \\in D^n$, then $x = f(x)$, and $x$ is a fixed point.\n\nIf $f$ has no fixed points, then $g(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in D^n$.  This implies that the continuous function $g$ maps $D^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We can use the degree of a continuous mapping.\n\nHowever, we need a modified function $h$ to apply the degree. Let $h(x) = \\frac{x-f(x)}{||x-f(x)||} \\in S^{n-1}$.  This function is continuous on $D^n$. If $f$ has no fixed points, then $h(x)$ is defined for all $x \\in D^n$. Now, the Brouwer degree of $h$ on $D^n$ is 1.\n\nHowever, $h(x)$ is defined for all $x \\in D^n$.  Consider the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset D^n$. If $f$ has no fixed points on $S^{n-1}$, then $g(x)$ maps the boundary to $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nWe can define $g: D^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Since $x \\in S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, $h(x) = \\frac{x-f(x)}{||x-f(x)||} = 1$ for all $x \\in D^n$ is undefined at $g(x)=0$\n\nThis implies the Brouwer degree of $h$ is 0 (or 1 depending on the precise definition).  Consider the degree of the mapping $g$ restricted to the boundary of $D^n$. If the degree of $g$ on the boundary of $D^n$ is 1, this will lead to a contradiction.  This would imply $f$ must have a fixed point.\n\nThis establishes a contradiction. Thus, the function $f$ must have at least one fixed point.\n\n**Conclusion:** Every continuous function mapping a closed n-dimensional ball to itself has at least one fixed point (Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem).\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's attempt to use the Brouwer degree is flawed and doesn't establish the desired contradiction related to the retraction of the ball to its boundary.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 4) | Action: verify_solution | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: Let $f: D^n \\to D^n$ be a continuous function.  Consider the homotopy $H(x, t) = x - t(x - f(x))$.  If $f(x) = x$ for some $x \\in D^n$, then $H(x, t) = x$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.  \n\nNow, consider $H(x, 0) = x$ and $H(x, 1) = f(x)$.  Note that $H(x, t) = x - t(x-f(x)) = x - tx + tf(x) = (1-t)x + tf(x)$.  This agrees with the previous steps' homotopy, but the point is to map $H(x, t) = x$.\n\nIf there are no fixed points, then $H(x, t) \\neq x$ for all $x \\in D^n$ and $t \\in [0, 1]$.  Consider $H(x, t) = 0$, so $x - t(x-f(x)) = 0$.  If $x = (1-t) x + tf(x)$, then $x-f(x) = 0$. This is precisely the condition that $x = f(x)$ (a fixed point).\n\nDefine $g(x) = x-f(x)$.  If $g(x) = 0$ has no solution, then $H(x, t) \\neq 0$.  We have $g(x) = 0 \\iff x-f(x) = 0 \\iff x = f(x)$, and this implies a fixed point.  We are searching for $x \\in D^n$ such that $g(x)=0$ for all $t$.\n\n\nBy the homotopy invariance property of Brouwer degree, if there are no fixed points, then the degree of the function $H(x, t)$ must be zero for all values of t.\n\nThe function $x \\mapsto f(x) - x$ sends points to vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  For $x \\in \\partial D^n$ (the boundary of $D^n$), $g(x) = x - f(x)$, $g(x) = 0$ means $x = f(x)$, which is a fixed point.\n\nWe use the fact that the degree of $H(x, 0) = id$ (identity) is 1 on $D^n$.  If there are no fixed points, then $H(x, 1) = f(x)$ will have no fixed points in $D^n$.  However, the degree of $H(x, 1) = f(x)$ must be 1 since the function is continuous.  If the function $f$ doesn't have a fixed point on $D^n$, then $H(x, t) \\ne x$. But $H(x, 0) = x$ which is the identity map, which has degree 1. By the homotopy invariance property, this must mean that $H(x, 1) = f(x)$ has degree 1. A contradiction arises if we assume $f(x)$ has no fixed points. Therefore, $f$ must have a fixed point.\n\nFinal Answer:  By contradiction, the existence of a fixed point is established.  The function $f(x)$ must have a fixed point in $D^n$.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student attempts a degree-theoretic proof, but makes several errors in its application, leading to a flawed argument.\n  ‚ö†Ô∏è Max retries reached for step 5.

Thus there exists some $\\delta > 0$ such that for $x \\in (a-\\delta, a+\\delta)$, $\\phi(x)$ is nonzero and $\\frac{\\phi(x) - \\phi(a)}{x-a}$ is non zero. \n\nAs $x \\to a$, $\\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}$ is equal to $f'(a) + \\epsilon \\frac{\\phi(x)-\\phi(a)}{x-a}$ which does not converge as $x \\to a$ for sufficiently small $\\epsilon$.  Thus, for a small enough $\\epsilon$, $g$ is not differentiable at $a$.\n\n\nTherefore, $g \\notin D_a$.  We have shown that for any $f \\in D_a$, there exists a function $g$ arbitrarily close to $f$ such that $g \\notin D_a$.\nThis implies that $D_a$ is not open.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student attempts to show $D_a$ isn't open, but their constructed function g, while continuous, uses a bump function $\\phi$ that is differentiable at $a$, and thus doesn't guarantee that g is not differentiable at $a$.\n  ‚ö†Ô∏è Max retries reached for step 3. Accepting incorrect step.\nStep 4/5 (Attempt 1) | Action: check_for_edge_cases | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: No intermediate errors are apparent.  The argument is sound, but the notation could be slightly improved for clarity.  \n\nThe crucial point is that if $\\phi(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ (which is assumed for the given $\\phi$), then $\\lim_{x\\to a} \\frac{\\phi(x)-\\phi(a)}{x-a}$ exists, and is equal to $\\phi'(a)$, which we've explicitly said is non-zero. The expression is correctly set up to use the differentiability at a.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's response appears to be evaluating a different problem involving the derivative of a function $\\phi(x)$, which is irrelevant to the application of the Baire Category Theorem to prove the existence of nowhere differentiable functions.\nStep 4/5 (Attempt 2) | Action: check_for_edge_cases | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: The previous step incorrectly focused on the derivative of a specific function $\\phi(x)$.  The key is to show that for any $f \\in D_a$, there exists a function $g$ arbitrarily close to $f$ such that $g \\notin D_a$.  We already have that construction.\n\n\nThe argument that $g \\notin D_a$ is correct if $\\epsilon$ is chosen sufficiently small.  The expression  $\\frac{\\phi(x) - \\phi(a)}{x-a}$ approaches the derivative $\\phi'(a)$ as $x \\to a$, which is non-zero for appropriately chosen $\\phi(x)$. This means $g(x)$ is not differentiable at $a$ for a small enough $\\epsilon$.\n\n\nNo intermediate errors or edge cases need to be checked since the argument correctly constructs a function $g$ arbitrarily close to $f$ that is not differentiable at $a$.  The key is that $\\phi(x)$ is chosen to be smooth enough to allow this construction to happen.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's submission focuses on showing $D_a$ is nowhere dense, which, while related, is not the correct approach using Baire Category Theorem; it should focus on showing $E_n$ is closed and nowhere dense.\nStep 4/5 (Attempt 3) | Action: simplify_result | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: Let $E_n = \\{f \\in C([0,1]) : |f'(x)| < n \\text{ for some } x \\in [0,1]\\}$.\n\nWe need to show $E_n$ is closed and nowhere dense.\n\nTo show $E_n$ is closed, consider a sequence $\\{f_k\\}$ in $E_n$ that converges to $f$ in $C([0,1])$.\nSince $f_k \\in E_n$, there exists $x_k$ such that $|f_k'(x_k)| < n$.\nSince $f_k \\to f$ uniformly, and the derivative is continuous if it exists, the sequence $\\{x_k\\}$ has a convergent subsequence $\\{x_{k_j}\\} \\to x$ in $[0,1]$.\nThen, $|f'(x)| \\le n$, so $f \\in E_n$.\n\nTherefore, $E_n$ is closed.\n\nTo show $E_n$ is nowhere dense, we need to show its complement $E_n^c$ is dense. Consider $g \\in C([0,1])$. By the Weierstrass approximation theorem, there exists a polynomial $p(x)$ such that $\\|g-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$.\nLet $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_n x^n$. Then $p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + ... + na_nx^{n-1}$.\nFor a given $x_0 \\in [0,1]$, we can choose $n$ sufficiently large so that $|p'(x_0)| > n$.\nThus, there exists a function $f(x)$ with a derivative exceeding $n$ at $x_0$.  This implies that $p(x) \\notin E_n$.\n\n\nConsider $f \\in C([0, 1])$ and suppose $|f'(x_0)| = M$ for some $x_0 \\in [0, 1]$. For some $x$ close to $x_0$, we have $|f'(x)| > M/2$ for all $x$ in a small neighborhood of $x_0$.  If $f'(x_0)$ is undefined or infinite, this condition is met.\n\nSince $p \\notin E_n$, we can find $p$ arbitrarily close to $g$. Thus, $E_n^c$ is dense.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's definition of E_n is incorrect, and the arguments for closedness and nowhere denseness are flawed.\nStep 4/5 (Attempt 4) | Action: simplify_result | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: Let $f \\in D_a$.  Since $f$ is differentiable at $a$,  $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = f'(a)$ exists.\n\nConsider the function $g(x) = f(x) + \\epsilon \\phi(x)$ where $\\phi(x)$ is a bump function supported in a small interval around $a$.  We have already shown that for sufficiently small $\\epsilon > 0$, $g$ is continuous but not differentiable at $a$.\n\nThus, we have shown that for any $f \\in D_a$ and any small $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a function $g = f + \\epsilon \\phi \\in C([0,1])$ that is arbitrarily close to $f$ in the supremum norm ($\\|g - f\\| = \\sup_{x \\in [0,1]}|g(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon$) but is not differentiable at $a$. This means that $g \\notin D_a$. Therefore, $D_a$ is not open in $C([0,1])$.\n\n\nSince $a$ was arbitrary, this holds for all $a \\in [0,1]$.  This implies that the complement of $D$ (the set of functions *not* differentiable at *any* point) is open.  The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space cannot be a countable union of nowhere dense sets.  $C([0,1])$ is complete under the supremum norm.  Since each $D_a$ is not open, and $[0,1]$ is a countable union of points, $D$ is not dense.\n\nTherefore, the complement of $D$ (the set of functions that are nowhere differentiable) must be nonempty. Consequently, there exists a continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student incorrectly concludes that the complement of D is open and that D is not dense, which doesn't follow from the fact that each $D_a$ is not open.\n  ‚ö†Ô∏è Max retries reached for step 4. Accepting incorrect step.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 1) | Action: verify_solution | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: Final Answer:\n\nBy the Baire Category Theorem, since $C([0,1])$ is a complete metric space and $D$ is a countable union of sets ($D_a$ for each $a \\in [0,1]$), which are not open,  the complement of $D$ (the set of functions in $C([0,1])$ that are nowhere differentiable) must be non-empty.  Therefore, there exists a continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student's argument is flawed because it doesn't establish that the sets in the countable union are nowhere dense, which is crucial for applying the Baire Category Theorem to conclude that the union has empty interior.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 2) | Action: verify_solution | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: The argument in the previous steps incorrectly asserted that the complement of $D$ (the set of functions that are nowhere differentiable) is open.  This is false.  The previous attempt conflated the idea of a function *not* differentiable *at a point* with *not* differentiable *anywhere*.\n\nThe correct approach:\n\nThe set $D_a$ of functions differentiable at $a$ is not open. We showed this.  However, this does *not* immediately imply that the complement of the set of functions differentiable *at any point* is non-empty.\n\n\nThe crucial step is recognizing that the union of the sets $D_a$, where $a \\in [0,1]$, is $D$, the set of all functions differentiable at *at least one* point in $[0,1]$.  To apply Baire Category Theorem, we need to argue that the sets $D_a$ are nowhere dense in $C([0,1])$.\n\n\nThe complement of $D$, $D^c$, is the set of functions that are *nowhere* differentiable.  If $D_a$ were nowhere dense, we could say that $D = \\bigcup_{a \\in [0,1]} D_a$, and the union has empty interior, since the sets $D_a$ have empty interior. This would imply the existence of a nowhere differentiable function, due to Baire Category Theorem.\n\nWe already showed that for any $a \\in [0,1]$, $D_a$ is not open.  This does not automatically mean it has empty interior. We need to show that the closure of $D_a$ contains a dense set of functions not in $D_a$, i.e., functions that are *not* differentiable at any $x \\in [0,1]$. This means $D_a$'s complement has non-empty interior.\n\nThis has been done by showing that *given* a function differentiable at $a$, we can construct a function arbitrarily close to it that is *not* differentiable at $a$.  Thus $D_a$ *is not closed*.\n\nGiven a point $a \\in [0, 1]$, the set $D_a$ is not closed. We have shown that for any $f \\in D_a$, there exist functions arbitrarily close to $f$ that are not in $D_a$. Thus, $D_a$ has empty interior. Thus the closure of its complement contains a dense set of functions that are not differentiable at $a$.\n\nSince $[0, 1]$ is countable, $D = \\bigcup_{a \\in [0,1]} D_a$ is a countable union of sets with empty interior.  Therefore, the interior of $D$ is empty, and consequently, the complement of $D$, $D^c$ (the nowhere differentiable functions), has non-empty interior.\n\n\nBy the Baire Category Theorem, $C([0, 1])$ cannot be a countable union of sets with empty interior. Therefore, there exists a function in $C([0, 1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n\nFinal Answer:  By the Baire Category Theorem, there exists a continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student incorrectly claims [0,1] is countable and attempts to use a countable union of $D_a$, which is not the correct application of the Baire Category Theorem in this context.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 3) | Action: final_answer_and_conclusion | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: Since $D_a$ is not open for each $a \\in [0,1]$, and the collection of all such sets $\\{D_a\\}_{a \\in [0,1]}$ is uncountable, the set $D = \\bigcup_{a \\in [0,1]} D_a$ is not open.  By the Baire Category Theorem, the complement of $D$ (the set of functions in $C([0,1])$ that are nowhere differentiable) cannot be a countable union of nowhere dense sets.  Since $C([0,1])$ is complete under the supremum norm, and $D$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets, the complement of $D$ must be non-empty.  Therefore, there exists a continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n\nFinal Answer:  By the Baire Category Theorem, there exists a continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student incorrectly claims $D$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets, when it is an *uncountable* union, and incorrectly applies the Baire Category Theorem.\nStep 5/5 (Attempt 4) | Action: final_answer_and_conclusion | Result: ‚ùå\n  üí¨ Learner: The set $D$ of functions in $C([0,1])$ that are differentiable at at least one point in $[0,1]$ is an uncountable union of sets $D_a$, where $D_a = \\{f \\in C([0,1]) : f \\text{ is differentiable at } a \\in [0,1]\\}$.  Each $D_a$ is not open in $C([0,1])$ as shown in previous steps.  Therefore, $D$ is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets.  The Baire Category Theorem does not directly apply to show that the complement of $D$ is nonempty.\n\nHowever, since each $D_a$ is not open, their union, $D$, is also not a dense subset of $C([0,1])$.  Since $C([0,1])$ is complete under the supremum norm, its complement, $D^c$ (the set of functions in $C([0,1])$ that are nowhere differentiable), must be nonempty.\n\nTherefore, there exists at least one continuous function in $C([0,1])$ that is nowhere differentiable.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT: The student incorrectly concludes that since $D$ is not dense, its complement must be nonempty; a set can be not dense and also have an empty complement (e.g., the set of rationals in the reals).\n  ‚ö†Ô∏è Max retries reached for step 5.

However, it's crucial to understand its properties and limitations concerning differentiation.  A standard Fourier series represents a periodic function.  While the Weierstrass function *looks* like a Fourier series, it's critically important to note that it's *nowhere differentiable*, despite its seemingly smooth appearance when plotted. This is a key characteristic of the function.\n\nThe series representation f(x) = Œ£ [from n=0 to ‚àû] a‚Åø * cos(b‚ÅøœÄx)  is a summation of cosine functions with frequencies that increase exponentially (b‚ÅøœÄ).  The amplitudes a‚Åø decay exponentially.  The condition 0 < a < 1 ensures the series converges, and ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ is a sufficient condition for the function to be nowhere differentiable. This condition ensures the high-frequency components don't \"cancel out\" in a way that would allow differentiability.\n\nTherefore, directly trying to differentiate the series term-by-term is not valid.  The standard theorem about term-by-term differentiation of infinite series requires uniform convergence of the differentiated series, which is *not* the case here.  The Weierstrass function serves as a classic counterexample to the naive expectation that a seemingly \"smooth\" function defined by an infinite series is necessarily differentiable.\n\nIn summary, this step highlights that while the Weierstrass function is *expressed* using a form reminiscent of a Fourier series, its nowhere differentiability prevents us from employing standard techniques of term-by-term differentiation.  The Fourier series representation itself, while insightful, doesn't provide a direct path to calculating the derivative; it reinforces the inherent non-differentiability of the function.  We need to explore alternative approaches in subsequent steps.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT. This step correctly explains why a naive approach of term-by-term differentiation is invalid for the Weierstrass function and sets the stage for explaining its non-differentiability.

Its self-similarity across different scales suggests analyzing its fractal dimension as an alternative approach to understanding its properties, even if not directly its derivative.  While we cannot find a traditional derivative, we can explore its fractal dimension to quantify its roughness and complexity.  Several methods can estimate the fractal dimension, but the most suitable for the Weierstrass function is arguably the box-counting method.\n\nThe box-counting method involves covering the graph of the function with a grid of boxes of size Œµ.  Let N(Œµ) be the number of boxes that intersect the graph of the function.  The fractal dimension D is then estimated by:\n\nD = lim (Œµ‚Üí0) [log(N(Œµ)) / log(1/Œµ)]\n\nThis limit represents the scaling behavior of the number of boxes as the box size decreases.  A higher fractal dimension indicates a more complex and irregular curve.\n\nFor the Weierstrass function, the fractal dimension is directly related to the parameters *a* and *b*.  While a precise analytical calculation of D for the general Weierstrass function is complex and often relies on approximations or numerical methods,  the condition *ab* > 1 + (3/2)œÄ strongly suggests a fractal dimension greater than 1.  A non-integer fractal dimension reflects the function's self-similarity and its non-Euclidean geometry.  The exact value of D depends on the specific values of *a* and *b*, and its calculation would involve a detailed analysis using the box-counting method, possibly with numerical computation for a given range of x.\n\n\nIn summary, this step proposes using fractal dimension analysis, specifically the box-counting method, as a suitable approach to characterize the Weierstrass function's irregularity and complexity, given its non-differentiability.  The fractal dimension provides an alternative metric to describe the function, even though it doesn't directly give us its derivative.  Subsequent steps would involve applying the box-counting method (potentially numerically) or exploring other fractal dimension estimation techniques to obtain a quantitative measure of the function's fractal nature.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While fractal dimension analysis can illuminate the function's roughness and non-differentiability, it does not contribute to proving the non-existence of the derivative and thus is a tangential exploration.

The most relevant concept here is the weak derivative.\n\nA weak derivative allows us to define a derivative even for functions that are not differentiable in the classical sense.  It leverages the properties of integration and the concept of distributions.  Let's consider a test function œÜ(x), which is infinitely differentiable and has compact support (i.e., it's zero outside a bounded interval).\n\nIf a function f(x) possesses a weak derivative f'(x), then it must satisfy the following condition for all test functions œÜ(x):\n\n‚à´‚Çã‚àû‚Å∫‚àû f(x)œÜ'(x) dx = -‚à´‚Çã‚àû‚Å∫‚àû f'(x)œÜ(x) dx\n\nThis equation is obtained by integrating by parts, assuming f(x) is differentiable.  However, the beauty of the weak derivative lies in the fact that this equation can *define* f'(x) even when f(x) isn't classically differentiable.  We can interpret f'(x) as a distribution (a generalized function).\n\nApplying this to the Weierstrass function:\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the Weierstrass function *does* possess a weak derivative, denoted by f'(x). Then, for any test function œÜ(x):\n\n‚à´‚Çã‚àû‚Å∫‚àû [Œ£(a‚Åøcos(b‚ÅøœÄx))]œÜ'(x) dx = -‚à´‚Çã‚àû‚Å∫‚àû f'(x)œÜ(x) dx\n\nThe problem lies in exchanging the summation and the integration.  The conditions for justifying this exchange (uniform convergence of the series and its derivative) are not met because the Weierstrass function's series representation does not satisfy these conditions, a fact already established in Step 1.\n\nTo directly prove the non-existence of even a weak derivative would require significantly more advanced techniques. We would need to analyze the behavior of the integral on the left-hand side for various test functions and demonstrate that no function f'(x) can satisfy the equation for all possible œÜ(x). This is beyond the scope of this step and would require a deeper delve into distribution theory and functional analysis.  However, the lack of classical differentiability, coupled with the failure of straightforward integration by parts, strongly suggests that a weak derivative also does not exist.  Further steps will need to formally address this.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the student correctly introduces the concept of weak derivatives, their reasoning about the Weierstrass function and its potential weak derivative is flawed and doesn't progress logically towards proving its non-existence.

Since the Weierstrass function is defined as a sum of cosine functions, its Fourier transform might offer insights into its differentiability.  Let's denote the Fourier transform of f(x) as F(œâ).\n\nThe Weierstrass function is given by:\n\nf(x) = Œ£ [from n=0 to ‚àû] a‚Åø cos(b‚ÅøœÄx)\n\nThe Fourier transform of cos(œâ‚ÇÄx) is given by:\n\nF{cos(œâ‚ÇÄx)} = œÄ[Œ¥(œâ - œâ‚ÇÄ) + Œ¥(œâ + œâ‚ÇÄ)]\n\nwhere Œ¥(œâ) is the Dirac delta function.  Therefore, the Fourier transform of a single term in the Weierstrass function series is:\n\nF{a‚Åøcos(b‚ÅøœÄx)} = a‚ÅøœÄ[Œ¥(œâ - b‚ÅøœÄ) + Œ¥(œâ + b‚ÅøœÄ)]\n\nNow, let's consider the Fourier transform of the entire Weierstrass function.  Ideally, we'd like to take the Fourier transform of the summation directly.  However, the conditions for exchanging the summation and the integral in the Fourier transform definition are stringent and are not met in this case.  The convergence of the Weierstrass function is not uniform, which is crucial for this exchange.\n\nTherefore, we can't directly compute F(œâ) by taking the Fourier transform term-by-term and summing the results. We are left with:\n\nF(œâ) = F{Œ£ [from n=0 to ‚àû] a‚Åø cos(b‚ÅøœÄx)}\n\nThis expression doesn't lend itself to a simple closed-form solution due to the non-uniform convergence.  However, we can make some qualitative observations:\n\n* **Discrete Spectrum:** The Fourier transform will have a discrete spectrum with peaks at œâ = ¬±b‚ÅøœÄ for n = 0, 1, 2, ...  These peaks correspond to the frequencies present in the cosine terms of the Weierstrass function.  The amplitude of each peak is proportional to a‚Åø.  Since 0 < a < 1, the amplitudes decay exponentially with increasing n.\n\n* **High-Frequency Components:**  Due to the condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ, the frequencies b‚ÅøœÄ increase exponentially. This means that the Weierstrass function contains significant high-frequency components.  This is a key indicator of its non-differentiability.  A differentiable function typically has a Fourier transform that decays sufficiently rapidly at high frequencies.  The slow decay (or lack thereof) in the high-frequency region of F(œâ) reflects the nowhere differentiability of f(x).\n\n* **Non-integrability of the derivative of F(œâ):**  If f(x) were differentiable, its Fourier transform F(œâ) would decay faster than 1/œâ.  The derivative of f(x) would have a Fourier transform proportional to œâF(œâ). The exponential nature of the frequencies in F(œâ) combined with the exponential decay of the amplitude does not guarantee that œâF(œâ) is integrable, hinting towards the lack of a derivative.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while we cannot obtain a closed-form expression for the Fourier transform, analyzing its qualitative features ‚Äì specifically the discrete spectrum with exponentially increasing frequencies and the likely non-integrability of  œâF(œâ) ‚Äì strongly supports the non-differentiability of the Weierstrass function.  This analysis provides further evidence, independent of the weak derivative argument, that confirms the inherent lack of differentiability of this function.  Further steps might involve more rigorous analysis using distribution theory to address this more formally.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the student's intuition about the connection between high-frequency components and non-differentiability is correct, the argument presented about the Fourier transform is flawed and doesn't rigorously establish the non-differentiability of the Weierstrass function.

The uniform convergence required for such an interchange is not guaranteed. Instead, let's consider a specific test function to illustrate the problem.\n\n\nLet's choose a test function œÜ(x) that is highly localized around a point x‚ÇÄ. For example, consider a sequence of \"bump\" functions œÜ<sub>k</sub>(x) defined as:\n\nœÜ<sub>k</sub>(x) = k * exp(-k¬≤x¬≤)\n\nAs k approaches infinity, œÜ<sub>k</sub>(x) approximates a Dirac delta function centered at x=0.  We can shift this function to center it at any x‚ÇÄ:  œÜ<sub>k,x‚ÇÄ</sub>(x) = œÜ<sub>k</sub>(x - x‚ÇÄ) = k * exp(-k¬≤(x - x‚ÇÄ)¬≤).\n\nNow, let's examine the left-hand side of equation (2) with this test function centered at x‚ÇÄ:\n\nL(k, x‚ÇÄ) = ‚à´<sub>-‚àû</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> [Œ£<sub>n=0</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> a<sup>n</sup>cos(b<sup>n</sup>œÄx)]œÜ'<sub>k,x‚ÇÄ</sub>(x) dx\n\nThe derivative œÜ'<sub>k,x‚ÇÄ</sub>(x) is sharply peaked around x‚ÇÄ and changes sign. The cosine terms in the summation oscillate with increasing frequency as n increases.  The integral involves the product of these rapidly oscillating cosine terms with the derivative of a sharply peaked function.  As k increases (the bump function becomes narrower), the oscillations of the cosine terms become more significant in relation to the width of the bump function's derivative, leading to a non-convergent or highly erratic behavior of the integral.  The integral won't behave smoothly and will not converge to a well-defined value regardless of the supposed weak derivative f'(x).\n\nSuppose a weak derivative f'(x) existed. Then the right-hand side of equation (2), -‚à´<sub>-‚àû</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> f'(x)œÜ<sub>k,x‚ÇÄ</sub>(x) dx, should converge to a value as k approaches infinity (due to the properties of the Dirac delta function). But the left hand side, L(k,x‚ÇÄ), does not converge to a well-defined value. This contradiction strongly suggests that no function f'(x) can satisfy the weak derivative condition for all test functions, including our chosen sequence of bump functions.\n\nTherefore, even a weak derivative does not exist for the Weierstrass function, a conclusion substantiated by the erratic behavior of the integral equation when using well-behaved test functions with increasing localization. This analysis, while not a rigorous full proof, provides strong evidence to support the non-existence of even a generalized derivative for the Weierstrass function.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the student's intuition is correct that the rapidly oscillating nature of the Weierstrass function prevents the existence of a derivative, their argument about the weak derivative using bump functions is flawed and doesn't constitute a valid proof.

Its graph exhibits self-similarity across different scales, a hallmark of fractal geometry.  We can explore this through the concept of fractal dimension.  Several methods exist for estimating the fractal dimension, but a common and relatively intuitive approach is the box-counting method.\n\n**Box-Counting Method:**\n\n1. **Covering the Graph:**  We overlay a grid of square boxes of side length Œµ onto the graph of the Weierstrass function over a given interval [a, b].\n\n2. **Counting Boxes:** We count the number of boxes, N(Œµ), that intersect the graph of the function.\n\n3. **Varying Box Size:** We repeat steps 1 and 2 for progressively smaller values of Œµ.\n\n4. **Log-Log Plot:** We plot log(N(Œµ)) against log(Œµ).  For a fractal curve, this plot will be approximately linear over a range of Œµ values.\n\n5. **Calculating Dimension:** The slope of the log-log plot provides an estimate of the fractal dimension, D.  Specifically, D = - lim<sub>Œµ‚Üí0</sub> [log(N(Œµ))/log(Œµ)].  In practice, we use the slope of the linear portion of the log-log plot for a range of Œµ values where the approximation holds.\n\n**Mathematical Considerations and Limitations:**\n\nThe box-counting method relies on the self-similarity of the Weierstrass function's graph. Because the Weierstrass function is nowhere differentiable, its graph contains infinitely fine details at all scales.  This is why the box-counting method is applicable. However,  practically, we are limited by the computational resolution. We cannot use arbitrarily small Œµ values.\n\nFurthermore, the exact fractal dimension of the Weierstrass function depends on the parameters 'a' and 'b'. There isn't a closed-form analytical expression for the fractal dimension that works for all parameter values. Numerical estimations are typically needed.  However, it's known that the fractal dimension D will be strictly greater than 1 (a smooth curve has dimension 1) and less than 2 (a plane has dimension 2).  The condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ ensures a fractal dimension greater than 1.\n\nAdvanced techniques from fractal geometry offer more precise methods for computing the fractal dimension.  These might involve techniques from multifractal analysis, which account for the non-uniform distribution of the function's values across scales.  However, the box-counting method provides a relatively accessible and illustrative approach to understanding the fractal nature of the Weierstrass function‚Äôs graph and its relation to the function's non-differentiability.  The key takeaway is that the fractal dimension quantifies the \"roughness\" of the graph, directly reflecting the function's nowhere differentiability.\n\nStep 5 would involve executing the box-counting method numerically or exploring more advanced methods to estimate the fractal dimension with specific choices of a and b, and analyzing the results in relation to the ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ condition.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the fractal nature of the Weierstrass function is interesting and related to its non-differentiability, exploring its fractal dimension is not a necessary or helpful step in proving its non-differentiability.

The integral on the LHS of (1) again involves the product of these pulses and the rapidly oscillating cosine terms of the Weierstrass function.  As k increases, the oscillations will become increasingly dominant within the support of the derivative, leading to similar erratic behavior and non-convergence of the LHS, contradicting the expected convergence of the RHS if a weak derivative existed.\n\n\n**2.  Compactly supported polynomial functions:** Let's consider a family of compactly supported polynomial functions, specifically Legendre polynomials scaled and shifted to be centered at x‚ÇÄ and with support shrinking with increasing k. These polynomials are infinitely differentiable. Their derivatives are also polynomials, and while smoother than the previous examples, the same problem will arise. The rapidly oscillating terms in the Weierstrass function, multiplied by these polynomials (or their derivatives) will still lead to highly oscillatory integrals. As k increases and the support shrinks, the integral will not converge to a predictable value, again contradicting the behavior expected from a well-behaved weak derivative.\n\n\n**General Argument:** The core issue lies in the interplay between the rapidly increasing frequency of the cosine terms in the Weierstrass function and the increasingly localized nature of the test function derivatives as we consider families of functions with shrinking support.  Regardless of the smoothness or specific properties of the test function family, the high-frequency oscillations of the Weierstrass function, combined with the localization of the derivative of the test functions, will inevitably lead to non-convergent or erratic behavior in the integral on the LHS of (1).  This behavior is inconsistent with the existence of a well-defined weak derivative, providing strong evidence for its non-existence.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of the integral equation using diverse families of test functions consistently reveals the non-convergence or erratic behavior of the LHS of the weak derivative condition, strongly supporting the conclusion that the Weierstrass function does not possess a weak derivative.  A complete rigorous proof would require more advanced techniques from functional analysis, but this step provides compelling heuristic evidence.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT.

While the previous steps focused on the failure of classical and weak derivative definitions, this step connects the function's non-differentiability to its fractal nature.\n\nThe Weierstrass function, despite its seemingly smooth graphical representation at coarse scales, exhibits self-similarity at increasingly fine scales.  Zooming in reveals repetitions of similar patterns, a hallmark of fractal structures. This self-similarity is directly linked to its nowhere differentiability.\n\nTo quantify this self-similarity and its relationship to differentiability, we consider the concept of fractal dimension.  Several definitions exist, but the Hausdorff dimension is particularly relevant.  Intuitively, the Hausdorff dimension measures how densely a fractal fills space.  A smooth curve has a Hausdorff dimension of 1, a surface has a dimension of 2, and a volume has a dimension of 3.  Fractals, however, can have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions.\n\nThe Weierstrass function does not possess a simple, easily calculated Hausdorff dimension.  Determining it requires advanced techniques from fractal geometry. However, we can conceptually connect its self-similarity and the increasing density of oscillations at finer scales to a Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than 1. The fact that its graph becomes increasingly \"dense\" as we zoom in suggests a dimension exceeding the dimension of a simple curve (dimension 1).  The exponentially increasing frequency of oscillations prevents the curve from behaving like a one-dimensional object in a measure-theoretic sense.\n\n\n**The Link to Non-Differentiability:**\n\nThe connection between fractal dimension and differentiability lies in the fact that functions with fractal graphs, and hence non-integer Hausdorff dimensions greater than 1, are typically nowhere differentiable.  The infinite self-similarity and the increasing complexity at arbitrarily small scales preclude the existence of a well-defined tangent at any point.  At each point, the function's behavior is perpetually \"rough,\" preventing the limit defining the derivative from existing.\n\nA rigorous proof of the Weierstrass function's fractal dimension and the formal connection to its non-differentiability would involve sophisticated measure theory and fractal geometry, beyond the scope of this step-by-step analysis.  However, we can conceptually link the observed self-similarity and the increasing density of oscillations with a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, which intuitively explains the absence of a derivative. The function's non-differentiability isn't just a consequence of its analytic definition but is fundamentally tied to its fractal nature and the resulting infinite complexity at all scales.  This perspective provides a geometrical intuition to complement the analytic approaches used in earlier steps.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While conceptually interesting, this step doesn't contribute a mathematically rigorous argument for non-differentiability and distracts from the core argument.

This step aims to provide further insight by exploring the connection between the function's fractal dimension and its lack of differentiability.  While this approach doesn't offer a direct, rigorous proof of non-differentiability in itself, it provides a valuable intuitive understanding.\n\n\nThe Weierstrass function exhibits self-similarity;  magnifying any portion reveals a structure similar to the overall function. This self-similarity is a hallmark of fractal structures.  The fractal dimension of a set quantifies the \"roughness\" or complexity of its structure.  Smooth curves have a fractal dimension of 1, while more complex, irregular curves have higher fractal dimensions.  The Weierstrass function possesses a fractal dimension greater than 1.  The exact value of the fractal dimension depends on the parameters 'a' and 'b' but is always strictly greater than 1 under the condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ.\n\nThe connection between differentiability and fractal dimension is that functions with fractal dimension greater than 1 are generally not differentiable.  Intuitively, a function's differentiability requires a certain degree of smoothness and regularity.  If the function's graph exhibits infinite detail and complexity at all scales (as indicated by a fractal dimension > 1), then it lacks the necessary \"smoothness\" to possess a derivative. The infinite oscillations at arbitrarily small scales prevent the existence of a well-defined tangent at any point.  The infinite self-similarity essentially means that no matter how much you zoom in, the curve remains just as \"rough\", precluding the existence of a derivative.\n\n\nA rigorous proof linking a fractal dimension greater than 1 to non-differentiability requires advanced techniques from fractal geometry and measure theory, and is beyond the scope of this step-by-step analysis.  However, the relationship provides a powerful heuristic argument. The fact that the Weierstrass function possesses a fractal dimension exceeding 1 is consistent with, and provides intuitive support for, its demonstrated lack of differentiability (in both classical and weak senses) as established in the previous steps.  This step enhances our understanding of why the function is nowhere differentiable by connecting its non-differentiability to a fundamental geometric property: its fractal nature.

Their interplay determines the highly oscillatory nature of the function and crucially impacts its differentiability.\n\n* **Parameter 'a' (0 < a < 1):**  This parameter controls the amplitude of each cosine term in the series.  Since 0 < a < 1, the amplitude of the cosine waves diminishes exponentially as *n* increases. This ensures the convergence of the infinite series, a necessary condition for the function to be well-defined. The rate of decay is directly proportional to 'a'; a smaller 'a' leads to faster decay of the amplitudes.\n\n\n* **Parameter 'b' (ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ):** This parameter controls the frequency of oscillation of each cosine term. The frequency increases exponentially with *n* as b‚Åø.  The condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ is critical. It ensures that the increase in frequency is sufficiently rapid to outweigh the decrease in amplitude.  This leads to the function's nowhere differentiability.  If 'b' were smaller, the oscillations might not be sufficiently dense to prevent the function from being differentiable at some points.  The specific condition ensures the rapid increase in frequency is sufficient to create a highly irregular, non-differentiable curve.  The larger 'b' is (relative to 'a'), the more rapid the frequency increase and consequently, the more chaotic the function's behavior becomes.\n\nIn essence, 'a' governs the decay of amplitude, ensuring convergence, while 'b' governs the rate of increase in frequency, guaranteeing the non-differentiability under the given condition.  The interplay between these two parameters, specifically the inequality ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ, is the key to understanding the function's highly irregular and non-differentiable nature.  The condition ensures that the increasingly high-frequency oscillations are not \"smoothed out\" by the exponentially decaying amplitude.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT.

Let's consider an arbitrary point x ‚àà ‚Ñù.  We will define two sequences, {x‚Çñ‚Å∫} and {x‚Çñ‚Åª}, converging to x from the right and left respectively.\n\nLet's choose an integer k ‚â• 1.  We define:\n\n**Sequence converging from the right (x‚Çñ‚Å∫):**\n\nx‚Çñ‚Å∫ = x + (1/(b·µèœÄ))\n\nThis sequence approaches x from the right as k ‚Üí ‚àû, since (1/(b·µèœÄ)) ‚Üí 0 as k ‚Üí ‚àû  (because b > 1).  The term (1/(b·µèœÄ)) is chosen strategically; it relates to the period of the highest-frequency cosine term that significantly contributes to the difference quotient at a given k.\n\n**Sequence converging from the left (x‚Çñ‚Åª):**\n\nx‚Çñ‚Åª = x - (1/(b·µèœÄ))\n\nSimilarly, this sequence approaches x from the left as k ‚Üí ‚àû.\n\n\nThe choice of  (1/(b·µèœÄ)) ensures that the difference between successive terms in these sequences directly relates to the period of the highest-frequency cosine term currently dominating the function's behavior around x as k increases. This strategic choice will be crucial in the subsequent steps when we analyze the difference quotient.  The convergence is guaranteed by the fact that  lim (k‚Üí‚àû) (1/(b·µèœÄ)) = 0 since b > 1.\n\nTherefore, we have successfully defined two sequences, {x‚Çñ‚Å∫} and {x‚Çñ‚Åª}, that converge to an arbitrary point x from the right and left, respectively.

The crucial observation is that the cosine terms with n > k will have relatively small contributions because their periods are much smaller than the spacing between x and x‚Çñ‚Å∫.  For those terms (n > k), the difference cos(b‚ÅøœÄx‚Çñ‚Å∫) - cos(b‚ÅøœÄx) will be small compared to the terms with n ‚â§ k.\n\nLet's examine the term for n=k:\n\na·µè [cos(b·µèœÄ(x + 1/(b·µèœÄ))) - cos(b·µèœÄx)] = a·µè [cos(b·µèœÄx + œÄ) - cos(b·µèœÄx)] = a·µè [-cos(b·µèœÄx) - cos(b·µèœÄx)] = -2a·µècos(b·µèœÄx)\n\nThis term, -2a·µècos(b·µèœÄx), will dominate the summation as k becomes large.  The terms with n < k will contribute, but their contributions will be relatively smaller as k increases, because the difference in cosine values decreases with decreasing n. While the terms with n > k will also contribute, these will tend towards zero given the rapid decrease in the period of oscillation with n and the fact that x‚Çñ‚Å∫-x is based on the period of the term with n=k.\n\n\nTherefore, for large k, the dominant term in the difference quotient [f(x‚Çñ‚Å∫) - f(x)] / (x‚Çñ‚Å∫ - x) is approximately:\n\nb·µèœÄ * (-2a·µècos(b·µèœÄx)) = -2œÄ(ab)·µècos(b·µèœÄx)\n\nA similar analysis applies to the left-hand difference quotient, yielding a dominant term with an equal magnitude but opposite sign. The key is that the term with n=k will dominate, due to its interplay with the carefully selected separation between x and x‚Çñ‚Å∫ (or x‚Çñ‚Åª).  Subsequent steps will use this dominant term to show the non-convergence of the difference quotient.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT.

The sign depends on whether we're approaching from the right or left.\n\nThe crucial aspect here is the term (ab)·µè.  Remember our condition: ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ.  This inequality is key to showing the unboundedness of the difference quotient.\n\nSince ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ > 1, the term (ab)·µè grows without bound as k ‚Üí ‚àû.  No matter how small or large x is, there will always exist values of k for which cos(b·µèœÄx) is close to ¬±1.\n\nLet's consider the absolute value of the dominant term: |2œÄ(ab)·µècos(b·µèœÄx)|.  Since |cos(b·µèœÄx)| ‚â§ 1, we can write:\n\n|2œÄ(ab)·µècos(b·µèœÄx)| ‚â§ 2œÄ(ab)·µè\n\nHowever, because (ab)·µè is unbounded as k approaches infinity, there will be an infinite number of values of k such that |2œÄ(ab)·µècos(b·µèœÄx)| is arbitrarily large. The term 2œÄ is a constant, and therefore the overall magnitude of the expression will also grow arbitrarily large as k increases.  Even though |cos(b·µèœÄx)| ‚â§ 1, the exponential growth of (ab)·µè dominates.\n\nSpecifically, for any M > 0, we can find a k such that  2œÄ(ab)·µè > M.  Since there are infinitely many values of k such that cos(b·µèœÄx) is close to 1 (or -1),  the absolute value of the dominant term, |2œÄ(ab)·µècos(b·µèœÄx)|, can exceed M infinitely often.  Thus, the difference quotient is unbounded. This shows the limit of the difference quotient as k approaches infinity does not exist, and therefore the derivative does not exist at x.  Since x was arbitrary, the Weierstrass function is nowhere differentiable.  The condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ ensures this unbounded behavior of the difference quotient, guaranteeing the function's nowhere differentiability.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT.

This is a direct consequence of the condition ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ, which ensures that (ab)·µè grows exponentially with k.  While the cosine term, cos(b·µèœÄx), oscillates between -1 and 1, the exponential growth of (ab)·µè overwhelms this oscillation.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as k ‚Üí ‚àû does not exist.  This non-existence of the limit implies that the derivative of the Weierstrass function does not exist at the arbitrarily chosen point x.\n\nSince x was an arbitrary real number, and the argument holds for any x ‚àà ‚Ñù, we conclude that the Weierstrass function, defined as f(x) = Œ£ [from n=0 to ‚àû] a‚Åøcos(b‚ÅøœÄx) with 0 < a < 1 and ab > 1 + (3/2)œÄ, is nowhere differentiable.

For any fixed x in (0, 1], as n approaches infinity, nx¬≤ approaches infinity, so e^(-nx¬≤) approaches 0. Consequently, 2nx * e^(-nx¬≤) approaches 0.  For x=0, f_n(0) = 0 for all n. Therefore, the pointwise limit function is f(x) = 0 for all x ‚àà [0, 1].\n\nNow, let's find the supremum of |f_n(x) - f(x)| = |f_n(x)| on [0, 1].  To do this, we find the maximum of f_n(x) on [0, 1].  We take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\nd/dx [2nx * e^(-nx¬≤)] = 2n * e^(-nx¬≤) - 4n¬≤x¬≤ * e^(-nx¬≤) = 0\n\nDividing by 2ne^(-nx¬≤) (since it's always positive for x in [0,1] and n>0) gives:\n\n1 - 2nx¬≤ = 0  =>  x¬≤ = 1/(2n)  =>  x = 1/‚àö(2n)\n\nSubstituting this value of x back into f_n(x):\n\nf_n(1/‚àö(2n)) = 2n * (1/‚àö(2n)) * e^(-n * (1/(2n))) = ‚àö(2n) * e^(-1/2)\n\nAs n approaches infinity, this maximum value also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, sup{|f_n(x) - f(x)| : x ‚àà [0, 1]} = sup{|f_n(x)| : x ‚àà [0, 1]} = ‚àö(2n)e^(-1/2) which tends to infinity as n tends to infinity.\n\nSince the supremum does not converge to 0 as n approaches infinity, the convergence of f_n(x) to f(x) = 0 is **not uniform** on [0, 1].\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT.

A simple function with poles at the integers is  f(z) =  csc¬≤(œÄz) = 1/sin¬≤(œÄz). However, this function has poles of order 2 at all integers, making the residue calculation somewhat cumbersome.  A more strategic approach utilizes a function with simple poles.\n\nLet's consider the function f(z) =  œÄ¬≤csc¬≤(œÄz) / z¬≤.  This function has:\n\n* **Poles at all integers:** The function has simple poles at all integers z = n (where n ‚â† 0) due to the  csc¬≤(œÄz) term. The denominator z¬≤ introduces a pole of order 2 at z=0 which complicates things, but we can deal with that later. The pole at z=0 is removable because the limit lim_{z‚Üí0} f(z) = œÄ¬≤. The œÄ¬≤ in the numerator is included for convenience in later calculations.\n\n* **Meromorphic nature:** The function is meromorphic because it's analytic everywhere except at its poles (the integers).\n\nThis function, f(z) = œÄ¬≤csc¬≤(œÄz) / z¬≤, presents a better starting point than simply using csc¬≤(œÄz). The extra z¬≤ in the denominator will simplify the residue calculations at non-zero integers, although the behaviour at zero requires separate handling. We'll address this pole (actually, this apparent pole which is removable) later.  This choice is crucial for the successful application of the residue theorem in the subsequent steps.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The student's choice of function f(z) = œÄ¬≤csc¬≤(œÄz) / z¬≤ introduces a pole of order 2 at z=0, which complicates the residue calculation there and the function's limit as z approaches 0 is not œÄ¬≤, it's infinity making the pole not removable; a better choice would be f(z) = œÄcot(œÄz)/z¬≤ as it has a pole of order 3 at z=0 and simple poles at non-zero integers.

A better approach is to consider the function  f(z) = œÄ cot(œÄz) / z¬≤.\n\nThis function has simple poles at all non-zero integers (z = n, where n ‚àà ‚Ñ§ \\ {0}) and a pole of order 3 at z = 0.  We will integrate this function around a suitable contour.  Let's consider a contour Cn consisting of a large circle with radius R (centered at the origin) and small semicircular indentations of radius Œµ around each of the poles on the real axis from -N to N (excluding zero). We then take the limit as Œµ approaches 0 and R approaches ‚àû.  This contour avoids all the poles of the function.\n\nThe integral we'll consider is:\n\n‚à´<sub>Cn</sub> f(z) dz = ‚à´<sub>Cn</sub> (œÄ cot(œÄz) / z¬≤) dz\n\nThis contour integral, by the residue theorem, will be equal to 2œÄi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at the poles *inside* the contour Cn.  The strategic choice of this contour allows us to connect the integral with the sum we are trying to prove. The detailed calculation of residues and the evaluation of the contour integral will be done in subsequent steps.  The key here is that the residue at z=0, despite being more complex to compute, is finite and the contribution from the large circle will vanish in the limit, leaving a sum related to the reciprocals of the squares of integers.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The student's contour avoids the poles, making the residue theorem inapplicable as there are no poles *inside* the contour.

We know the Laurent series expansion of cot(œÄz) around z=0 is:\n\ncot(œÄz) = 1/œÄz - œÄz/3 - (œÄ¬≥z¬≥)/45 - ... = Œ£_{n=0}^‚àû (-1)^n (2^{2n} B_{2n} (œÄz)^{2n-1})/(2n)!\n\nwhere B_{2n} are the Bernoulli numbers.\n\nTherefore,\n\nœÄ cot(œÄz) = 1/z - œÄ¬≤z/3 - (œÄ‚Å¥z¬≥)/45 - ...\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = œÄ cot(œÄz) / z¬≤ = (1/z - œÄ¬≤z/3 - (œÄ‚Å¥z¬≥)/45 - ... ) / z¬≤\n\nf(z) = 1/z¬≥ - œÄ¬≤/3z - œÄ‚Å¥z/45 - ...\n\nThe residue of f(z) at z=0 is the coefficient of the 1/z term in the Laurent series expansion.  In this expansion, there is no 1/z term.  However, we made an error by considering only the terms that were clearly contributing to 1/z in the expansion. A more rigorous approach is necessary.\n\nLet's use the known series expansion for cot(x) around x=0:\n\ncot(x) = 1/x - x/3 - x¬≥/45 - ...\n\nThen, for small z:\n\ncot(œÄz) ‚âà 1/(œÄz) - œÄz/3\n\nTherefore,\n\nœÄ cot(œÄz) ‚âà 1/z - œÄ¬≤z/3\n\nSubstituting into f(z):\n\nf(z) ‚âà (1/z - œÄ¬≤z/3) / z¬≤ = 1/z¬≥ - œÄ¬≤/3z\n\nThis confirms that there is no 1/z term in the Laurent series, indicating that the residue at z=0 is 0. This seemingly contradicts our initial expectation. We must remember that we are approximating,  and higher-order terms in the expansion of cot(œÄz) need to be considered to confirm this result rigorously.  However, the crucial point is there's no 1/z term, and hence the residue at z=0 is 0.  The residue is indeed 0.  This is correct and expected given the nature of our chosen contour.  It allows us to proceed to sum only the residues at non-zero integers.\n\n**Therefore, the residue of f(z) at z = 0 is 0.**\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The student incorrectly concludes the residue at z=0 is 0, due to mistakes in the Laurent series expansion and misinterpreting its meaning.

This contribution, however, will be finite and is part of the complete residue calculation, which is left for the next step.  It is incorrect to assume this contribution vanishes. The residue at z=0 is indeed finite (as we will see in the next step), and this contribution will be incorporated into the overall sum of residues.\n\n\nIn summary:  As R ‚Üí ‚àû, the integral along the large circle vanishes.

A rigorous proof often uses degree theory, which itself is built upon homotopy theory.  Let's review the necessary components:\n\n**1. Topological Spaces and Continuous Maps:**\n\nWe're working with the closed n-dimensional ball D‚Åø = {x ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Åø : ||x|| ‚â§ 1}, a compact and convex subset of ‚Ñù‚Åø.  The function *f*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø is given as continuous.  Continuity here means that for every open set U in D‚Åø, the preimage f‚Åª¬π(U) is also open in D‚Åø.  This is crucial because continuous functions preserve topological properties.\n\n**2. Homotopy:**\n\nTwo continuous maps *f*, *g*: X ‚Üí Y between topological spaces X and Y are homotopic if there exists a continuous map H: X √ó [0, 1] ‚Üí Y such that H(x, 0) = f(x) and H(x, 1) = g(x) for all x ‚àà X.  Intuitively, a homotopy represents a continuous deformation of one map into another.  The importance here lies in the fact that homotopic maps share certain topological invariants.\n\n**3. Degree Theory (for maps from S‚Åø‚Åª¬π to itself):**\n\nThis is where things get more sophisticated. We need to understand degree theory specifically for maps from the (n-1)-dimensional sphere S‚Åø‚Åª¬π (the boundary of D‚Åø) to itself.  For a continuous map *g*: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π, the degree, deg(g), is an integer that intuitively measures the number of times the map \"wraps\" the sphere around itself, accounting for orientation.  More formally:\n\n* **Intuitive Explanation:**  Imagine a small region on S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  Its image under *g* will be another region.  The degree roughly represents the net number of times the image of this region covers the target sphere, positive if orientation is preserved, negative if reversed.\n\n* **Formal Definition:** This requires more advanced algebraic topology tools like homology theory. The degree is defined using the induced homomorphism on the (n-1)-th homology group of the sphere.  deg(g) = g<sub>*</sub>(Œ≥), where Œ≥ is a generator of H<sub>n-1</sub>(S‚Åø‚Åª¬π).   The key here is that this integer is a homotopy invariant: if two maps are homotopic, they have the same degree.\n\n\n**4. Extension of maps:**\n\nA critical aspect for linking the boundary to the interior is the idea of extending maps.  If we have a continuous map *g*: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π, the question arises whether this map can be extended to a continuous map *F*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø.  This relates to the notion of homotopy and degree.\n\n\nThis review establishes the necessary background to approach a proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, often via a proof by contradiction utilizing the degree of a map from the boundary of the ball to itself.  The next steps will build upon these concepts.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT. This step accurately reviews relevant topological concepts necessary for understanding the eventual proof, including continuity, homotopy, and degree, and sets the stage for the contradiction argument involving retraction.

Assume that the continuous function *f*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø has *no* fixed points.  This means that for all x ‚àà D‚Åø, f(x) ‚â† x.\n\nFor each x ‚àà D‚Åø, the line segment connecting x and f(x) is well-defined because f(x) is within D‚Åø.  We can define a vector pointing from f(x) to x as:  v(x) = x - f(x). Since f(x) ‚â† x, v(x) is non-zero. We can normalize this vector to create a unit vector pointing in the same direction:\n\nu(x) = v(x) / ||v(x)||\n\nNow, consider the map *g*: D‚Åø ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π defined by:\n\ng(x) = x + u(x)   This step contains an error as mentioned below\n\nThis mapping *g* is designed to point from each point *x* in *D*‚Åø outward, *radially* towards the boundary *S*‚Åø‚Åª¬π. Note that if x is already on the boundary, then g(x) will be outside the ball. We will need to amend g(x).\n\nThis definition of g(x) has a critical flaw: it's not guaranteed that g(x) lies on S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  The vector u(x) extends from f(x) to x; simply adding it to x might take the result outside the unit ball.  We need a better construction to ensure g(x) lies on the boundary.\n\n\nLet's define a new mapping h: D‚Åø ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π:\n\nh(x) = (x - f(x)) / ||x - f(x)||   for x ‚àà D‚Åø\n\nThis map is well-defined because our assumption is that f(x) ‚â† x for all x in D‚Åø. This ensures that the denominator is never zero. Now we can define our homotopy H:\n\nH(x,t) = (1-t)x + t * h(x)    for x ‚àà D‚Åø and t ‚àà [0,1].\n\nThis homotopy continuously deforms the identity map on D‚Åø (H(x,0) = x) to the map that projects each point radially onto the boundary S‚Åø‚Åª¬π (H(x,1) = h(x)).\n\nWe now restrict H to the boundary S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  Let's define H'|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π x [0,1]</sub>: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π x [0,1] ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π\n\nThis restricted homotopy continuously deforms the identity map on S‚Åø‚Åª¬π (H'(x,0) = x) to a map that is the composite of the radial projection from x to S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  This is a crucial step since the radial projection is not well-defined on the interior of D‚Åø, thus we needed to restrict the homotopy to the boundary.\n\nThe identity map on S‚Åø‚Åª¬π has degree 1, while the projected map will need further analysis, but the contradiction lies in the fact that if it has a different degree, this would contradict that the degree is a homotopy invariant. The subsequent steps will complete the proof using degree theory to formalize this contradiction.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The student's construction of the retraction is flawed and the homotopy argument is not clearly connected to homology theory as outlined in the expected solution.

This means that for all x ‚àà D‚Åø,  *f*(x) ‚â† x.\n\nThis assumption allows us to construct a retraction. Since *f*(x) ‚â† x for all x in D‚Åø, we can define a continuous map *r*: D‚Åø ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π  as follows:\n\nFor each x ‚àà D‚Åø, the line segment connecting x and *f*(x) is well-defined because *f*(x) is always distinct from x.  We define *r*(x) to be the intersection of this line segment with the sphere S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  More formally:\n\n*r*(x) = x + Œª( *f*(x) - x)\n\nwhere Œª is a scalar chosen such that || *r*(x) || = 1.  Solving for Œª, we obtain:\n\nŒª =  [‚àö(1) - ||x|| ] / [ ||f(x) - x|| ]\n\n\nThis Œª is well-defined because  ||f(x) - x|| > 0 (since f(x) ‚â† x), and the numerator is non-negative and is zero only when ||x||=1 which means x is on the boundary and therefore the denominator is 0 which is undefined. We should exclude this case.  If x is on the boundary then r(x)=x, we will deal with this issue after checking continuity.\n\n\nThe continuity of *r* follows from the continuity of *f* and the fact that the above expression for Œª defines a continuous function of x as long as f(x)‚â†x. We will check this later after we deal with the edge case.  The function *r* is a retraction because for any x ‚àà S‚Åø‚Åª¬π,  *r*(x) = x (this would be obvious from the geometric construction).  This is because if x is in S‚Åø‚Åª¬π then ||x|| = 1 which will result in Œª=0 and r(x) = x. \n\nTherefore, *r* maps the entire ball D‚Åø onto its boundary S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  The existence of this retraction will lead to a contradiction, which will ultimately prove the theorem.  The contradiction will arise when considering the degree of the map from S‚Åø‚Åª¬π to itself.\n\nThe next step will focus on demonstrating this contradiction using properties of the degree and homotopy theory.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The formula for Œª is incorrect, leading to an ill-defined retraction on the boundary, and the continuity argument is incomplete.

When x ‚àà S‚Åø‚Åª¬π,  ||x|| = 1, so Œª = 0, and thus *r*(x) = x.  Therefore, *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>(x) = x for all x ‚àà S‚Åø‚Åª¬π, which means *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> is precisely the identity map id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>.\n\nTo demonstrate homotopy, we need a continuous map H: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π √ó [0, 1] ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π such that H(x, 0) = *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>(x) and H(x, 1) = id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>(x).  Since *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> is already the identity map, we can simply define the homotopy as:\n\nH(x, t) = x  for all x ‚àà S‚Åø‚Åª¬π and t ‚àà [0, 1].\n\nThis is clearly a continuous map because it's the constant map in the t variable for each fixed x. Moreover, we have:\n\n* H(x, 0) = x = *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>(x)\n* H(x, 1) = x = id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>(x)\n\nTherefore, the restriction of *r* to S‚Åø‚Åª¬π is homotopic to the identity map on S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  This demonstrates that *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> and id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> are homotopic, a crucial step for the upcoming contradiction.  The continuity of r needs to be addressed in the next step, specifically in handling the edge case which we deferred in the previous step.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT. This step correctly shows that the restriction of the constructed retraction *r* to the boundary S‚Åø‚Åª¬π is the identity map, and therefore homotopic to the identity, which is a necessary component of the contradiction argument.

A key property of the degree is its homotopy invariance: homotopic maps from S‚Åø‚Åª¬π to itself have the same degree.  Therefore, deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = deg(id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>).\n\nThe degree of the identity map id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> is 1. This is because the identity map does not \"wrap\" the sphere around itself; it simply maps each point to itself, preserving orientation.  Therefore, deg(id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.\n\nConsequently, deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.\n\nNow, let's address the continuity of *r*(x) and handle the edge case where ||x|| approaches 1.  Recall  Œª = (1 - ||x||) / ||f(x) - x||. As ||x|| ‚Üí 1, the numerator approaches 0. However, since *f*(x) ‚â† x for all x ‚àà D‚Åø,  ||f(x) - x|| remains strictly positive, preventing division by zero.  The limit of Œª as ||x|| ‚Üí 1 is 0, which results in a continuous extension to the boundary (r(x)=x when x is on the boundary).  Therefore, the map *r* is continuous on D‚Åø.\n\nHowever, *r* maps the entire n-dimensional ball D‚Åø onto its (n-1)-dimensional boundary S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  Intuitively, it's impossible to continuously map a higher-dimensional space onto a lower-dimensional space without \"collapsing\" some points.  This \"collapsing\" implies that the degree of *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> should be 0. This is a formal consequence of the fact that a continuous map from a higher-dimensional ball to a lower-dimensional sphere always has a degree of 0.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradiction: deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1 and deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 0. This contradiction stems from our initial assumption that there exists a continuous function *f*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø without a fixed point.  Thus, this assumption must be false, proving Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem.  The degree of the map from the n-dimensional ball to the (n-1) dimensional sphere is 0 because the sphere is not a retract of the ball. This is a consequence of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.  This completes the proof by contradiction.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the student correctly identifies the contradiction using degree theory, the explanation for why the degree of *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> should be 0 is imprecise and invokes unnecessary concepts like the Borsuk-Ulam theorem.

Recall *r*(x) = x + Œª(f(x) - x), where Œª = (1 - ||x||) / ||f(x) - x||.  The potential issue lies at the boundary where ||x|| = 1. However, we showed in step 2 that  if ||x||=1, then Œª=0, and r(x)=x. Thus, the formula for r(x) is well defined even on the boundary.\n\nTo prove the continuity of r(x), we need to consider a sequence {x_n} converging to some x in D‚Åø.  If x is in the interior of D‚Åø, then the continuity follows directly from the continuity of f(x) and the formula for Œª.\n\nIf x is on the boundary, let x_n ‚Üí x.   Then ||x_n|| ‚Üí ||x|| = 1.  We have two cases.\n\nCase 1:  x_n is always on the boundary. Then r(x_n) = x_n, and r(x_n) ‚Üí x = r(x).\nCase 2:  There exists a subsequence of {x_n} in the interior. Let's consider x_k in the interior. Then r(x_k) = x_k + Œª_k (f(x_k)-x_k) where Œª_k = (1 - ||x_k||) / ||f(x_k) - x_k||. As k‚Üí‚àû, Œª_k ‚Üí 0, and r(x_k) ‚Üí x.\n\nThus, in both cases, the continuity holds, making r(x) continuous on D‚Åø.\n\nNow, let's consider the degree.  The restriction of *r* to S‚Åø‚Åª¬π, *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>, is the identity map (as shown in Step 3).  Therefore, deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = deg(id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.\n\nHowever, *r* is a retraction from D‚Åø onto S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  This means that *r* maps the entire n-dimensional ball onto its (n-1)-dimensional boundary.  Intuitively, it's impossible to continuously retract a ball onto its surface without \"collapsing\" some points. This collapsing means the map *r* must be less than injective which is equivalent to having zero degree. More formally, because the image of r is contained within the (n-1)-dimensional sphere (which is lower dimensional than the domain D‚Åø), it cannot be surjective.  A surjective map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space must be proper, and by a result in degree theory, any map with a lower dimensional image has degree zero. Therefore, deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) must be 0.\n\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1 and deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 0 simultaneously.  This contradiction arises from our initial assumption that there exists a continuous function *f*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø without a fixed point.  Therefore, every continuous function from D‚Åø to itself must have at least one fixed point.  This completes the proof.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the continuity argument is mostly correct, the reasoning about the degree being simultaneously 1 and 0 is flawed and doesn't align with the expected use of homology.

Specifically, deg(g) = g<sub>*</sub>(Œ≥), where Œ≥ is a generator of H<sub>n-1</sub>(S‚Åø‚Åª¬π;‚Ñ§) ‚âà ‚Ñ§.  The identity map id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> induces the identity homomorphism on homology, so (id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>)<sub>*</sub>(Œ≥) = Œ≥, which means deg(id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.\n\nOur retraction *r*: D‚Åø ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π restricts to a map *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π.  As shown previously, *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub> is homotopic to the identity map id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>.  A crucial property of the degree is its homotopy invariance: homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on homology, and therefore have the same degree.  Thus, deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = deg(id<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.\n\nHowever, we now consider the map *r*: D‚Åø ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π from a topological perspective.  The n-dimensional ball D‚Åø is contractible (it can be continuously deformed to a point), and its (n-1)-th homology group is trivial: H<sub>n-1</sub>(D‚Åø;‚Ñ§) = 0.  The induced homomorphism *r*<sub>*</sub>: H<sub>n-1</sub>(D‚Åø;‚Ñ§) ‚Üí H<sub>n-1</sub>(S‚Åø‚Åª¬π;‚Ñ§) maps the trivial group to the integers.\n\nLet i: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π ‚Üí D‚Åø be the inclusion map.  Then the composition *r* ‚àò i: S‚Åø‚Åª¬π ‚Üí S‚Åø‚Åª¬π is our restriction *r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>.  The induced homomorphism on homology is (*r* ‚àò i)<sub>*</sub> = *r*<sub>*</sub> ‚àò i<sub>*</sub>.  Since H<sub>n-1</sub>(D‚Åø;‚Ñ§) = 0, the induced homomorphism *r*<sub>*</sub> must be the zero homomorphism.  Therefore, (*r* ‚àò i)<sub>*</sub>(Œ≥) = *r*<sub>*</sub>(i<sub>*</sub>(Œ≥)) = *r*<sub>*</sub>(0) = 0.\n\nThis implies deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 0, contradicting our earlier result that deg(*r*|<sub>S‚Åø‚Åª¬π</sub>) = 1.  This contradiction stems from our initial assumption that a fixed-point-free continuous map *f*: D‚Åø ‚Üí D‚Åø exists.

We want to characterize the set of nowhere differentiable functions in C([0, 1]) as a countable intersection of open sets.\n\nLet D<sub>n</sub> be the set of functions f ‚àà C([0, 1]) such that there exists at least one point x ‚àà [0, 1 - 1/n] for which\n\n| (f(x + 1/n) - f(x)) / (1/n) | ‚â§ n\n\nThis inequality essentially states that there exists a point where the slope of the secant line over an interval of length 1/n is bounded by n.  Note that if a function is differentiable at a point x, then its derivative is the limit of such secant slopes as n approaches infinity. A function is nowhere differentiable if this condition fails for every x in [0,1].\n\nNow, let's analyze the complement of D<sub>n</sub>, denoted by D<sub>n</sub><sup>c</sup>.  D<sub>n</sub><sup>c</sup> consists of functions f such that for all x ‚àà [0, 1 - 1/n],\n\n| (f(x + 1/n) - f(x)) / (1/n) | > n\n\nLet's show that D<sub>n</sub> is closed and therefore D<sub>n</sub><sup>c</sup> is open:\n\nConsider a sequence {f<sub>k</sub>} in D<sub>n</sub> converging uniformly to f in C([0, 1]).  For each f<sub>k</sub>, there exists x<sub>k</sub> ‚àà [0, 1 - 1/n] such that |(f<sub>k</sub>(x<sub>k</sub> + 1/n) - f<sub>k</sub>(x<sub>k</sub>))/(1/n)| ‚â§ n.  Since [0, 1 - 1/n] is compact, there exists a subsequence {x<sub>k<sub>j</sub></sub>} converging to some x ‚àà [0, 1 - 1/n].

This space is complete.\n\nInstead of directly characterizing nowhere differentiability, we will characterize its *negation*:  differentiability at at least one point.  We will show that the set of functions differentiable at at least one point is meager (i.e., a countable union of nowhere dense sets).  Then, by the Baire Category Theorem, its complement ‚Äì the set of nowhere differentiable functions ‚Äì must be dense.  This doesn't directly prove existence of a *single* nowhere differentiable function, but it demonstrates that such functions are far from exceptional; they are dense in C([0,1]).\n\nLet D<sub>n</sub> be the set of functions in C([0,1]) such that there exists at least one point x ‚àà [0,1] where the function's derivative exists and its absolute value is ‚â§ n.

Let's consider an arbitrary function f ‚àà D<sub>n</sub> and an arbitrary Œµ > 0. We need to show that the open ball B(f, Œµ) = {g ‚àà C([0,1]) : ||f - g|| < Œµ} contains a function that is *not* in D<sub>n</sub>.\n\nSince f ‚àà D<sub>n</sub>, there exists a point x<sub>0</sub> ‚àà [0,1] such that |f'(x<sub>0</sub>)| ‚â§ n.  Let's construct a function g ‚àà B(f, Œµ) such that g is not in D<sub>n</sub>.  We'll do this by adding a high-frequency, small-amplitude perturbation to f.\n\nConsider a continuous function h(x) with the following properties:\n\n1.  ||h|| < Œµ/2  (h is small in the sup norm).\n2.  h is highly oscillatory near x<sub>0</sub>, such that for any interval containing x<sub>0</sub>, the function g = f + h has unbounded difference quotients.  For example, we could construct h using a continuous version of the Weierstrass function, scaled down to have magnitude less than Œµ/2 and concentrated near x<sub>0</sub>. A specific construction might involve something like h(x) = (Œµ/4) * sin(k(x-x‚ÇÄ)) with k being a very large integer. The key is that the derivative of h will be unbounded.\n\nNow let g(x) = f(x) + h(x).  We have:\n\n* ||f - g|| = ||h|| < Œµ/2 < Œµ, so g ‚àà B(f, Œµ).\n* Because h has unbounded difference quotients in any neighborhood of x‚ÇÄ and f has a bounded derivative at x‚ÇÄ,  the difference quotients of g = f + h will be unbounded in any interval containing x‚ÇÄ.  This means g is not differentiable at x<sub>0</sub>.\n\nFurthermore, careful construction of h ensures that g will not be differentiable anywhere else either. This is the difficult part in the complete proof and requires more advanced techniques to ensure this doesn't introduce differentiability at another point.  This part is usually handled by carefully controlling the size and location of the oscillations using a more sophisticated construction of h, often based on recursively defined functions.\n\nSince g ‚àà B(f, Œµ) and g ‚àâ D<sub>n</sub>, we've shown that no open ball centered at a point in D<sub>n</sub> is entirely contained within D<sub>n</sub>. Therefore, the interior of D<sub>n</sub> is empty.  This completes the proof that D<sub>n</sub> is nowhere dense.  The detailed construction of h to guarantee non-differentiability everywhere is left to subsequent steps, but the core idea of the argument is established here.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, While the student's intuition is correct and the approach is reasonable, the specific construction of h and the claim that it guarantees non-differentiability everywhere is flawed and insufficiently rigorous for this step.

In other words, no matter how small a neighborhood around f we consider, we can always find a function within that neighborhood which is not in D<sub>n</sub>.\n\nLet f ‚àà D<sub>n</sub>.  By definition, there exists x ‚àà [0,1] such that |f'(x)| ‚â§ n. Let Œµ > 0.  We need to construct a function g such that ||f - g|| < Œµ and g ‚àâ D<sub>n</sub>.  This means g is nowhere differentiable or, at least, nowhere differentiable where |g'(x)| ‚â§ n.  We will achieve this using a high-frequency oscillation.\n\nConsider a continuous, nowhere differentiable function h: [0,1] ‚Üí ‚Ñù such that ||h|| < Œµ/2.  The existence of such functions is well-known (a standard example is a suitably scaled Weierstrass function).  We define g(x) = f(x) + Œ¥h(k(x-x‚ÇÄ)), where k is a large positive integer (to be determined) and Œ¥ is a small constant such that |Œ¥| < Œµ/2.  x‚ÇÄ is the point where |f'(x‚ÇÄ)| ‚â§ n.\n\nNow, let's analyze the derivative of g if it exists:  g'(x) = f'(x) + kŒ¥h'(k(x - x‚ÇÄ)).  However, h is nowhere differentiable, and thus, h'(x) is undefined everywhere. Importantly, due to the high frequency k, even if f' exists near x‚ÇÄ, the term kŒ¥h'(k(x-x‚ÇÄ)) would introduce oscillations of arbitrarily large magnitude, preventing |g'(x)| from being bounded by n everywhere near x‚ÇÄ.  We can't directly argue about the derivative of h.\n\nInstead, we consider the difference quotients. If g were differentiable at some point y with |g'(y)| ‚â§ n, then the difference quotients of g around y must be bounded by n. However, the high frequency oscillation introduced by h, amplified by k, ensures that arbitrarily close to y, the difference quotients will be much larger than n in magnitude due to the non-differentiability of h. This is guaranteed for a sufficiently large k.  Since we can choose a large enough k and sufficiently small Œ¥, ||f - g|| < Œµ while preventing g from having a derivative smaller than n in magnitude at any point.  Therefore,  g ‚àâ D<sub>n</sub>.\n\nSince this holds for arbitrary f ‚àà D<sub>n</sub> and Œµ > 0, we conclude that D<sub>n</sub> has empty interior.\n\n\nThis construction leverages the properties of a known nowhere differentiable function to create a perturbation that disrupts the differentiability of f, rigorously establishing that D<sub>n</sub> has an empty interior without directly relying on the derivatives of h itself but on the unboundedness of the difference quotients.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: INCORRECT, The student's argument uses an incorrect definition of D<sub>n</sub>, focusing on the magnitude of the derivative being bounded by n, rather than the Lipschitz condition |f(x) - f(x‚ÇÄ)| ‚â§ n|x - x‚ÇÄ|.

Our construction in Step 3 guarantees that we can find a function g ‚àà B(f, Œµ) such that g ‚àâ ‚à™<sub>n=1</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> D<sub>n</sub>. This is because we can construct g = f + Œ¥h(k(x - x‚ÇÄ)) where h is a continuous nowhere differentiable function, k is a sufficiently large integer, and Œ¥ is a sufficiently small constant. This g is nowhere differentiable and lies within the Œµ-ball around f.  Since f and Œµ were arbitrary, this means that every open ball in C([0,1]) contains a function that is not in ‚à™<sub>n=1</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> D<sub>n</sub>.\n\nThis directly implies that the closure of ‚à™<sub>n=1</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> D<sub>n</sub> has an empty interior.

We will achieve this by constructing an open ball that does not intersect cl(D<sub>n</sub>).  We will not use the D<sub>n</sub> sets defined previously, as those are unsuitable for proving nowhere differentiability via the Baire Category Theorem.

A function differentiable at x has a bounded difference quotient in a neighborhood of x, hence it satisfies a Lipschitz condition at x.\n\nTo show that cl(L<sub>n</sub>) is not dense, we need to find an open ball in C([0, 1]) that does not intersect cl(L<sub>n</sub>).  Consider a continuous, nowhere differentiable function h with ||h|| = 1. Such functions exist.  Let f be any continuous function on [0, 1].  Let Œµ > 0.  Consider the function g(x) = f(x) + Œµh(kx) where k is a positive integer.  This is a continuous function, and ||f - g|| = ||Œµh(kx)|| ‚â§ Œµ||h|| = Œµ < Œµ. Thus, g is in the Œµ-ball around f.\n\nNow, suppose g ‚àà L<sub>n</sub> for some n. Then there exists x ‚àà [0, 1] and Œ¥ > 0 such that |g(x + h) - g(x)| ‚â§ n|h| for all |h| < Œ¥.  However, because h is nowhere differentiable,  the difference quotient |h(k(x + h)) - h(kx)|/|h| is unbounded as h approaches 0.  Specifically, for any M > n, there exists an h such that  |h(k(x + h)) - h(kx)|/|h| > M.\n\nConsequently, for a sufficiently large k,  |g(x + h) - g(x)| = |f(x + h) - f(x) + Œµ(h(k(x + h)) - h(kx))| > n|h| for some |h| < Œ¥.

The Baire Category Theorem, applied to the complete metric space C([0, 1]), states that a complete metric space is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets.  Consequently, the complement of ‚à™<sub>n=1</sub><sup>‚àû</sup> L<sub>n</sub> is non-meager and, in fact, dense in C([0, 1]).\n\nThis complement is precisely the set of continuous functions on [0, 1] that are nowhere differentiable.  Therefore, the set of nowhere differentiable functions is dense in C([0, 1]).  This completes the proof using the Baire Category Theorem.\n  üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Judge: CORRECT. The student correctly applies the Baire Category Theorem to show the set of nowhere differentiable functions is dense in C([0,1]).
